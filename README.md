# hello-world
trying this tutorial thing for github

So this would make an alternative for the original readme file.
Feels like a great update. Can't wait for it to go live.

Guess I'd like to write some code, just because it's github?
So here's a <a href src="https://xkcd.com/">link</a>, minimal effort.

That's all for now. Bye.
